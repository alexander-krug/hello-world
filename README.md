Just another repository

Hey fellow githubbers!

I am Alex, I got into IT at a very young age and was introduced to Linux in 2016 which really changed my views on the topic of open source.

It is going to be great to learn from all of you, looking forward to everything Github has to offer.

Cheers
Alex
